# INTRODUCTION

•	This project mainly comprises of different features along with their corresponding specified target.<br/><br/>
•	The project focuses on predicting the particular areas (i.e. Rural, Industrial, urban and some other areas) on the basics of features available like for ex. <b>Concentration of s02, n02 gases rspm, spm, location, date, can be able enough to determine the existing condition</b> of a particular state and then, can be easily predict that in which area that particular state falls. So, the main aim is to focus on features classification as on the basis of this only our trained machine would be able to predict accurately and efficiently, as, we know the fact that the efficiency of machine mainly comprises its ability to give full accuracy. The project includes the prediction of accuracy of a state to which areas it falls.<br/><br/>
•	So, taking an initiation to raise this project up to our assumed results.<br/>




# DATA SELECTION
Dataset-
All the data presented here has been taken from KAGGLE REPOSITORY and going to make our own dataset from 35Lakhs<b>+</b> records. I've taken only those columns which is required for my project and save it in project.csv file. 

# Dataset Reference –

# CONCLUSION
Lastly the conclusion mainly comprises of determination of accuracy prediction on the basis of our calculated test values. So, can say that after performing the whole set of procedures on the given dataset had reached a conclusion that using the the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN), a non-parametric classification method model, had gained the accuracy of our project in the sense representing the correct calculated estimations.

Screenshot of our accuracy is given below:
